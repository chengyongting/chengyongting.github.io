Hi there!

# About Me

I am a master's student majoring in Computer Science in <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/index.html">Mckelvey School of Engineering</a> at <a href="https://wustl.edu/"> Washington University in St. Louis</a> and I am dedicated to the study of medical image analysis and deep learning. My research interests include machine learning, optimization, and computational imaging. 

I received my B.E in Electrical Engineering at <a href= "https://www.wtu.edu.cn/"> Wuhan Textile University. </a> 

# Research
I am genuinely interested in medical image analysis with deep learning, including cross-modal synthesis tasks by using deep generative models
and image segmentation tasks solved by U-Net and fully convolutional network. I was lucky to work with <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/xiaofeng"> Dr. Xiaofeng Liu</a> as a visiting student at Harvard Medical School during Summer 2021. Our project focused on synthesizing PET(Positron emission tomography) from MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) with cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks for Alzheimerâ€™s disease diagnosis. I also had a wonderful research experience advised by <a href="https://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/~roger/">Prof. Roger Chamberlain</a> during Summer 2020. This experience was focusing on high-performance computing and accelerating FPGAs by using the OpenCL platform. 

I am seeking a PhD opportunity or a full-time industry job starting in Summer 2022! ðŸŽ‰
Please feel free to contact me if you know any possible availability of PhD positions or if you want to discuss with me about PhD applications or algorithms for job-seeking.
