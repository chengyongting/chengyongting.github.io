- CSE554A Geometric Computing for Biomedicine CSE559A Computer Vision
  - Advances in biomedicine have been powered by the continued enhancement of data acquisition techniques. Many of these techniques produce image data in two or three dimensions, such as microscopy, MRI, CT, ultrasound, EM, to name a few. To visualize these image data, and further to perform quantitative analysis, it is often useful to extract geometric forms, such as curves and surfaces, from the images. Not only do they offer intuitive means for visual presentation, geometric forms also enable efficient and robust computational algorithms for data understanding and processing. This course covers some of the most commonly used geometric algorithms in image analysis, including morphology analysis, skeletonization, surface reconstruction, mesh processing, model deformation and registration.
